Shloka is a fourth-year undergraduate at Columbia University studying Applied Mathematics with a view towards ecology. Her academic interests lie in biogeochemistry, theoretical ecology, and waste management. She aims to use tools from mathematics and computer science to investigate plant-microbial communities in their changing geochemical environments. 

Shloka is particularly interested in biocrusts, communities of cyanobacteria, lichen, and nonvascular plants that extensively cover the global terrestrial surface. She is currently working with Mingzhen and Chris Kempes on the emergence of spatiotemporal order in biocrust communities from simple growth, death, and competitive constraints.
