I'm an incoming PhD student in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at Princeton University and recent graduate of Columbia University, where I studied Applied Mathematics. 

I aim to use tools rooted in mathematics and computer science to investigate life in its changing geochemical environment. I work with [Erwan Monier](https://lawr.ucdavis.edu/people/faculty/monier-erwan) at UC Davis on biocrust contributions to the global carbon and nitrogen budget. Previously, I was at the [Santa Fe Institute](https://www.santafe.edu/) developing a model of biocrust growth, death, and competitive controls on regional biogeochemistry with [Mingzhen Lu](https://www.mingzhenlu-lab.com/) and [Chris Kempes](https://www.santafe.edu/people/profile/chris-kempes). My research is supported by an [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/) and a [Straubel Fellowship](https://www.straubelfoundation.org/straubelfellows).

When I’m not doing research, I’m watching [IMDb's Top 250](https://www.imdb.com/user/ur130076546/?ref_=nv_usr_prof_2) movies, thinking about ethics and metaphysics, [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/145758547-shloka), or spending time outdoors!
