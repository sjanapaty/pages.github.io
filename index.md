I'm a fourth-year undergraduate at Columbia studying Applied Mathematics with a view toward earth system science. My academic interests are in biogeochemistry, theoretical ecology, and waste management, and I aim to use tools rooted in mathematics and computer science to investigate life in its changing geochemical environment.

I currently study biocrusts, communities of cyanobacteria, lichen, and moss that extensively cover the global terrestrial surface. At UC Davis, I work with [Erwan Monier](https://lawr.ucdavis.edu/people/faculty/monier-erwan) on biocrust contributions to the global carbon and nitrogen budget. This summer, I'm at the [Santa Fe Institute](https://www.santafe.edu/) developing a model of biocrust growth, death, and competitive controls on dryland biogeochemistry with [Mingzhen Lu](https://www.mingzhenlu-lab.com/) and [Chris Kempes](https://www.santafe.edu/people/profile/chris-kempes). My research is supported by a Straubel Fellowship.

When I’m not doing research, I’m either racking up my [IMDb Top 250](https://www.imdb.com/user/ur130076546/?ref_=nv_usr_prof_2) count, thinking about ethics and metaphysics, [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/145758547-shloka), or spending time outdoors!
