I'm a PhD student in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at Princeton University advised by [Simon Levin](https://eeb.princeton.edu/people/simon-levin) and [Lars Hedin](https://eeb.princeton.edu/people/lars-hedin). I'm also recent graduate of Columbia University, where I studied Applied Mathematics. My research is supported by an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship and a Straubel Fellowship.

When I’m not doing research, I’m watching [IMDb's Top 250](https://www.imdb.com/user/ur130076546/?ref_=nv_usr_prof_2) movies, thinking about ethics and epistemology, [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/145758547-shloka), or spending time outdoors!

This website houses lots of information about me, including my research, notes, and miscellaneous ideas. Please feel free to reach me sj9547 [at] princeton [dot] edu or calendar a [meeting](https://zcal.co/sj9547/30min)!
