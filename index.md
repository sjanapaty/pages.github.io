I'm a PhD student in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at Princeton University advised by [Simon Levin](https://eeb.princeton.edu/people/simon-levin) and [Lars Hedin](https://eeb.princeton.edu/people/lars-hedin). I'm also recent graduate of Columbia University, where I studied Applied Mathematics. My research is supported by an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship and a Straubel Fellowship.

I aim to use tools from mathematics to investigate life in its changing geochemical environment. The kind of ecological theory I enjoy most is:
<ul>
    <li><b>low-dimensional</b>: what is the simplest representation of this problem?</li>
    <li><b>cross-disciplinary</b>: where different fields interface and new applications arise</li>
    <li><b>meaningful</b>: provides fundamental insight into animal welfare, vulnerable biogeochemical stocks, and other neglected problems</li>
</ul>  

Previously, I worked with [Erwan Monier](https://lawr.ucdavis.edu/people/faculty/monier-erwan) at UC Davis on biocrust contributions to the global carbon and nitrogen budget. I was also at the [Santa Fe Institute](https://www.santafe.edu/) developing a model of biocrust growth, death, and competitive controls on regional biogeochemistry with [Mingzhen Lu](https://www.mingzhenlu-lab.com/) and [Chris Kempes](https://www.santafe.edu/people/profile/chris-kempes).
