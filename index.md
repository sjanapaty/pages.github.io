I'm a PhD student in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at Princeton University advised by [Simon Levin](https://eeb.princeton.edu/people/simon-levin) and [Lars Hedin](https://eeb.princeton.edu/people/lars-hedin). I'm also recent graduate of Columbia University, where I studied Applied Mathematics. 

I aim to use tools rooted in mathematics and computer science to investigate life in its changing geochemical environment. The kind of ecological theory I enjoy most is:
<ul>
  <li>low-dimensional: what is the simplest, most elegant representation of this problem?</li>
  <li>cross-disciplinary: where different fields interface and new applications arise</li>
  <li>meaningful: provides fundamental insight into animal welfare, vulnerable biogeochemical stocks, and other neglected problems</li>
</ul>  

Previously, I worked with [Erwan Monier](https://lawr.ucdavis.edu/people/faculty/monier-erwan) at UC Davis on biocrust contributions to the global carbon and nitrogen budget. I was also at the [Santa Fe Institute](https://www.santafe.edu/) developing a model of biocrust growth, death, and competitive controls on regional biogeochemistry with [Mingzhen Lu](https://www.mingzhenlu-lab.com/) and [Chris Kempes](https://www.santafe.edu/people/profile/chris-kempes). My research is supported by an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship and a Straubel Fellowship.

When I’m not doing research, I’m watching [IMDb's Top 250](https://www.imdb.com/user/ur130076546/?ref_=nv_usr_prof_2) movies, thinking about ethics and epistemology, [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/145758547-shloka), or spending time outdoors!
