I'm a PhD student in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at Princeton advised by [Simon Levin](https://eeb.princeton.edu/people/simon-levin) and [Lars Hedin](https://eeb.princeton.edu/people/lars-hedin). I'm also recent graduate of Columbia University, where I studied Applied Mathematics. My research is supported by an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship and a Straubel Fellowship.

The kind of ecological theory I enjoy most is:
<ul>
    <li><b>low-dimensional</b>: what is the simplest representation of this problem?</li>
    <li><b>cross-disciplinary</b>: where different fields interface and new applications arise</li>
    <li><b>meaningful</b>: provides fundamental insight into animal welfare, vulnerable biogeochemical stocks, and other neglected problems</li>
</ul>  

My PhD work is at the intersection of biogeochemistry and theoretical ecology. I am particularly interested in using tools from mathematics to examine the role of <b>resource allocation strategies in community assembly</b>, especially in: (1) the trajectory from pioneer to seral communities, (2) spatial vegetation patterning, and (3) animal mortality.

Previously, I worked with [Erwan Monier](https://lawr.ucdavis.edu/people/faculty/monier-erwan) (UC Davis) on carbon and nitrogen cycling in biocrusts. I was also at the [Santa Fe Institute](https://www.santafe.edu/) developing a model of resource competition in biocrusts with [Mingzhen Lu](https://www.mingzhenlu-lab.com/) and [Chris Kempes](https://www.santafe.edu/people/profile/chris-kempes).
